 Assignment #4: Responsive Portfolio Website

The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website to showcase my software engineering portfolio. The site consists of
a home section with an image of software engineering in action and a brief introduction. The next section outlines my technology
skills. In the next section, there are GitHub links to 4 of my recent projects. Finally, there is a contact form that can be used
to send me an email message.
