 Assignment #4: Responsive Portfolio Website
 Public URL: https://geneknjit.github.io/portfolio-website/

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website to showcase my software engineering portfolio. The site contains a brief introduction, skills, projects, and a contact form.

# Website Features
Home
The home page starts with a colorful picture depicting software engineering in action. I give a brief introduction and have 4 buttons
on the right side of the page: home, skills, projects, and contact. When a button is clicked, it is highlighted and that section becomes active while the others are hidden.

Skills
This section has 3 panels explaining some of my skills such as programming, web development, and cloud technology.

Projects
Here I showcase 4 of my recent programming projects with an appropriate image for each and a GitHub link. As you hover over each image
(or click on them if on mobile) the image is replaced with a GitHub link to the project. The links also have animation changing the
color scheme as you hover.

Contact
Finally, the contact section give you a few different ways to get in touch with me. I provide contact information, my social media links,
and a form that can be filled out to send me an email. There is simple validation on the form fields to make sure they are filled out
correctly. The submit button makes use of https://formspree.io/ to send me an email.

# Challenges
While working on this project I did encounter some challenges. The basic design of the website was taken from the tutorial video suggested
in the course Pages. While the tutorial was very helpful, it was sometimes difficult to understand some of the decisions made and how I
could adapt them for my website. Another challenge I faced was making the site look and feel good with different screen sizes. I used copilot
to help with media queries to adjust the controls. Once I saw how this was being done, I learned how I could make more adjustments and refine
the look of the site for several ranges of screen sizes. Another challenge was the contact form. I eventually decided to go with a temporary
solution in Formspree to send the email.
